## [2.2.0]
### Breaking changes
- We had to change the `FormsNavigationPageService` to support re-locating the `NavigationPage` for Android when it relaunches the Activity. Because of that, we cannot support setting the `Navigation` property - if you are using this, it will now throw a `NotSupportedException` and you will need to provide your own implementation of the service.
- The `DependencyServiceExtension` now uses the wrapper - so it can create objects and inject dependencies. This means you do not need to register ViewModel objects.
- Updated the Xamarin.Forms package.

## XamU.Core [2.1.1]
- Fix bug in `ObservableDictionary` so it's property raising `PropertyChange` notifications on `Item[key]` to allow Forms to see it.

## XamU.Infrastructure [2.1.0]
- Allows `XamUInfrastructure.Init` to be called multiple times for native Android initialization in an Activity.
- Fixed a bug in `ObservableCollection` to ensure it always reports change notifications even when `MassUpdate` is not being used.
- Added unit tests to check new features.

## [2.0.0]
### Breaking changes
- New property on `IntegerToBoolean` which allows for a test of `One` vs. `Zero`.
- The `NavigateAsync` methods on `INavigationService` have been split into multiple methods instead of default parameters.
- There's a new interface `IViewModelNavigationInit` which is used to initialize a ViewModel post-creation.
- `FormsNavigationPageService` supports the new ViewModel initialization support.
- `SimpleViewModel` implements the new `IViewModelNavigationInit` interface and forwards it to a virtual method.
- `SimpleViewModel.RaisePropertyChanged` is now virtual and used to raise all property changes so it can be overridden.
- A new version of `IDependencyService.Get<T>` is available which takes a `DependencyScope` parameter to determine whether a new instance or global instance is returned.

## [1.6.0]
### Breaking changes
- Refined namespaces - might need to change some `using` statements.
